## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Economic Outcomes based on Population Density in America:

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How does population density in rural and urban areas across North and South America influence overall financial activity, the number of startups, and their economic impact on GDP of America?


## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project examines how population density in rural and urban regions across America impacts financial activity, startup formation, and their contributions to GDP. By analyzing data from North and South America, we aim to understand how different density levels shape economic outcomes in various socioeconomic contexts. Using datasets on demographics, financial activity, and startup metrics, weâ€™ll employ statistical methods to identify patterns and relationships. Our findings are expected to reveal density-driven factors that can support economic growth, offering insights for policymakers and investors to develop strategies that promote balanced development in diverse areas across America.
