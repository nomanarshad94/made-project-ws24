# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Investigating the Relationship Between Startup Density and Household Income in U.S. Metropolitan Areas
<!--Economic Outcomes based on Population Density in Americas-->

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
Can an increase in startup density causes higher average household income in metropolitan area? 
<!-- 2. What is the impact of educational attainment on financial activity in metropolitan area? -->

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->

The project aims to provide insights into the impact of startup ecosystems on household income, potentially informing policymakers and regional developers about the economic benefits of fostering startup growth. Findings may suggest that policies supporting startups can lead to income growth in metropolitan areas, creating a stronger case for entrepreneurial investment as an economic growth strategy.

<!--This project examines how population density in rural and urban regions across America impacts financial activity, startup formation, and their contributions to GDP. By analyzing data from North and South America, we aim to understand how different density levels shape economic outcomes in various socioeconomic contexts. Using datasets on demographics, financial activity, and startup metrics, weâ€™ll employ statistical methods to identify patterns and relationships. Our findings are expected to reveal density-driven factors that can support economic growth, offering insights for policymakers and investors to develop strategies that promote balanced development in diverse areas across America.-->
